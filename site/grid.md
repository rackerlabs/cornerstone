## Responsive Columns

This responsive grid varies the gutter widths depending on the number of columns in your layout to enhance readability. Wider (fewer) columns are given more whitespace while narrow (more) columns receive a less generous portion.

The structure is pretty straight forward. To add 3 columns, just give 3 divs `class="col-1of3"`â€”adding `class="col-1of3 last"` to the final div to remove the right margin. There aren't any pushes or pulls. Just blocks to place content or leave blank `class="col-1of3 blank"`. Example below.
